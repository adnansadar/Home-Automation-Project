# Home-Automation-Project
This is my Engineering Design and Development(EDD) Project which I have done in first semester of my First Year B.Tech.

## Overview
  We created an Android app which communicated with the Arduino Uno using the bluetooth microcontroller.
  You can turn the lights on/off by just clicking on the buttons in the app.
  We also added a voice module feature to this app which makes it convenient by just giving voice commands on your phone.
  All this can be done up to 20m range.
  
## Requirements
  1. Arduino IDE
  2. Android Studios(SDK)
  3. Java Development Kit(JDK)
  4. Arduino Uno Board
  5. 4 Channel Relay Module
  6. Bluetooth Module HC05
  7. AC Source
